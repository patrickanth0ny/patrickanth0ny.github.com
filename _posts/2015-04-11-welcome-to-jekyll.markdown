Just started a page on github pages using jekyll as a static site generator. So far I have just been learning how jekyll operates and how it builds the site. I hope to implement some sort of gallery and tutorial section.

I should have alot of free time to write since I am currently unemployed and mildly addicted to heroin, but that's another story altogether. This page is all about programming, upcomming technology and trends, occational stock, finance and business postings and when I read something cool about ITSec I'll be sure to write about it here.
